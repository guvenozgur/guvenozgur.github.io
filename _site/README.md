I have made this into a Jekyll Theme.
**Demo:** [http://webjeda.com/online-cv/](http://webjeda.com/online-cv/)

The default theme would look like this

# Installation: 
Fork the ``master`` branch and delete ``gh-pages`` branch in it. This is important because ``gh-pages`` branch is used here only to host the blog. You should be using the master branch as the source and create a fresh ``gh-pages`` branch.

## How to delete old **gh-pages** branch?
After forking the repository, click on **branches**.

Delete ``gh-pages`` branch.

You have to create a new ``gh-pages`` branch using the master branch. Go back to the forked repository and create ``gh-pages`` branch.

Now, go to settings and check the **Github Pages** section. You should see a URL where the blog is hosted. If not select a branch as source.
